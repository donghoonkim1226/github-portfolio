  	<p>My name is Dong Hoon Kim. I went to Syracuse University for 3 and half years but was not able to graduate due to financial issues. At that young age, I thought I could take a leave of absence and work to save money for school. One thing led to another and now I have found myself 6 years deep in the work force. By chance I stumbled upon Rutgers Coding Boot Camp and found myself thinking quite deeply about my future. After some time thinking, I knew learning the skills to become a full stack developer would make up for my missing degree. It would open up career paths and new opportunities and help me find a career that I enjoy. Once I have successfully completed the Boot Camp I do plan on also pursuing my degree. I have lived a majority of my life in New Jersey. I know reside in Tappan NY but I will always be a New Jersian in my heart. Diners, Taylor Ham? Come on! Whats not to love about Jersey. I am a die hard Jets Fan, J E T S JETS! JETS! JETS! I love cars, I love the sound the engine makes, the sound of the exhaust. The way the car hugs the fresh tarmac, the wind blowing in your face. The simplicity and beauty of the way a car looks, I just love cars! I "had" a 2013 Hyundai Genesis Coupe - Complete Stage 2 tune. But back in 2014, someone on RT 46 decided to cut through the solid line divider and crashed into my baby. Due to my commute to work and Rutgers Coding Boot Camp I am now driving a 2016 Honda Accord Sport that is amazing on the gas mileage! I am a gear head.</p>
